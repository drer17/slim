# Notes

- Options for the view can be set in the command section.
  - this means that they are all keyboard accessible and consistent across pages
  - New entries can be added based on the text in the command input
    - New entries should only need only one user defined field (maximum)
    - This enables quick additions and edit later (for descriptions, adding attributes etc)
